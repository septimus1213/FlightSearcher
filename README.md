# FlightSearcher
 
A simple app that searches for cheap flights and sends email notifications about them.
It requires the Tequila API (https://tequila.kiwi.com/), a Google-sheet, and an email address (duh).

and then it could be converted into an API using Sheety. (https://sheety.co/)

(Obviously this is not a serious project. It was a simple learning exercise to learn about API-s.)
